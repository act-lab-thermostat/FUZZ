## Introduction
FUZZ++ is a scripting language for all your cozy coding needs. Imagine, its raining outside, you're wearing your fuzzy jacket and your favorite pair of UGGs, and you didn't make it to class. You open your computer at home and can't wait to get your code on. You know that FUZZ++ is the go-to programming language for these types of #codingvibes. FUZZ++ is cozy, comfortable (with lots of practice), and most importantly fun!
