## Introduction
FUZZ++ is a scripting language for all your cozy coding needs. Imagine, its raining outside, you're wearing your fuzzy jacket and your favorite pair of UGGs, and you didn't make it to class. You open your computer at home and can't wait to get your code on. You know that FUZZ++ is the go-to programming language for these types of #codingvibes. FUZZ++ is cozy, comfortable (with lots of practice), and most importantly fun! 

## Features
- Data Structures
- Statically Typed
- Streams
- If Statements
- For Loops, While Loops

## Examples

### Data Types
- boolean: `cozy` and `not_cozy`
- string: `'my UGGs are soooo comfortable'`
- integer: `1`, `100`, `420`
- float: `1.5`, `3.14`, `70.34799`
- None: `None`
- list: `[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`, `[['compilers', 'operating systems'], ['interaction design', 'plang', 'theory']]`
- dictionary: `{'UGGs': cozy, 'jackets': cozy, 'FUZZ++': cozy, 'lair food': not_cozy}`
- set: `{1, 2, 95, 7}`

### Variable Declarations
Every new variable is declared using the keyword `fuzz` followed by its identifier.
```
fuzz annies_coffee_cart_order = 'iced chai with almond milk and a shot'!
fuzz num_of_juuls_chris_has_lost = 27!
fuzz meels_favorite_snack = 'hot cheetos'!
fuzz dondi_wears_airpods = cozy!
```
Notice that every line ends in an exclamation mark, `!`, and that is because cozy coding is just so much fun!
